     * Return a copy of this crossword with only the down clues (usually).
     *
     * Solving with down clues generally works because all the theme answers, which are typically
     * the longest answers in the grid, run across the grid. Thus, it's generally possible to infer
     * their answers from a few of the crossing letters, even without knowing the clue. However,
     * some themes have more theme material running down the grid, in which case it is "fairer" to
     * solve with only the across clues.
     *
     * Thus, we use a rough heuristic to decide which direction of clues is more useful: if one
     * direction's max word length is longer than the other's, we clear the clues in that direction;
     * otherwise, we use the number of words of that max length in each direction as a tiebreaker.
     * If there are an equal number of max-length words in both directions, we return the puzzle
     * with only the down clues.
